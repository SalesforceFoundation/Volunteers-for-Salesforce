				<p>Volunteers for Salesforce supports Volunteer Recurrence Schedules and Job Recurrence Schedules with the help of a batch process to

				to automatically run nightly.</p>
				<p>You will see a progress bar below for the most recent batch process.
				 The process may take some time; it will take longer the more data you have in your database.  You can close this page
